# ygodb_cleanup

To submit any string corrections, first tell us on discord, which cards you will be working on so we can split the work. This project will take a while, but once its complete, it will be the most accurate database. Submit a cdb with the number range you did. For example, I am doing the first 100 cards, so my cdb will be cards_1-100.cdb. This contains only the text table. You will also need to look at the corresponding script to understand what effect is being referenced.
